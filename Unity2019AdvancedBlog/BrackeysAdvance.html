      <p>This is the first of 15 posts on my exploration of a breath of advanced Unity topics. I will go through a series of Brackey's tutorials and implement the projects outlined in the video. I then want to write up my reflection here detailing what I learned inluding a visual and then how related skills can be applied more generally in a professional setting. My hope is by the end of 2 weeks to have a showcase of my skills beyond programing and more specifically as a Unity developer.</p>
